# Remaining Useful Life (RUL) Prediction using LSTM

This project predicts the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of industrial equipment using deep learning (LSTM) on time-series sensor data.

## Objective
To build a predictive maintenance model that estimates how long a machine can operate before failure.

## Dataset
Multivariate time-series sensor dataset with operational and condition data.

## Methods
- Data Cleaning & Normalization  
- Feature Engineering  
- LSTM Model Training  
- Model Evaluation using MSE & MAE  

## Results
The model successfully learned temporal patterns and produced accurate RUL predictions for predictive maintenance use cases.

## Tools & Technologies
Python, TensorFlow/Keras, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
